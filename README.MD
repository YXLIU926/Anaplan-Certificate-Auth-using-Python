Anaplan's API 2.0 supports both basic authentication and CA certificates. However for quite a long time, I had troubles finding a proper certificate authentication script on Anaplan's community site. I then built this Anaplan certificate authentication script based off on this article https://community.anaplan.com/t5/How-To/Generating-Authentication-Strings-for-Using-CA-Certificates-with/ta-p/53403 and further added the authentication end point part. 

Python Version: 3.7.1
